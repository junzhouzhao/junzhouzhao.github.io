Junzhou Zhao received the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and
Engineering from [[http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/][Xi’an Jiaotong University]], under the supervision of
[[http://mail.sei.xjtu.edu.cn/tpl/sei/staff/xhguan.html][Prof. Xiaohong Guan]].
He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering of [[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/][The Chinese University of Hong
Kong]], working with [[http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/][Prof. John C.S. Lui]].
His research focuses on mining and measuring massive large-scale
networks/graphs with a particular interest in online social networks,
a.k.a. the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science][network science]].

[[./img/news.gif]] I am available on the job market, and interested in
becoming a research scientist, data scientist, or software engineer.

* Research

network science, large-scale graph measuring and mining, statistical
inference, streaming methods, recommendation system, user behavior
modeling in networks
