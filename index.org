* About
Junzhou Zhao received the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from [[http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/][Xi’an Jiaotong University]], under the
supervision of [[http://mail.sei.xjtu.edu.cn/tpl/sei/staff/xhguan.html][Prof. Xiaohong Guan]]. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering of [[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/][The Chinese University of Hong Kong]], working with [[http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/][Prof. John C.S. Lui]]. His research focuses on mining and
measuring massive large-scale networks/graphs with a particular interest in online social networks, a.k.a. the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science][network
science]].

[[./img/news.gif]] I am available on the job market, and interested in becoming a research scientist, data scientist, or
software engineer.

* Research

large-scale graph measuring and mining, statistical inference methods, streaming
algorithms, recommendation system, user behavior modeling in networks
