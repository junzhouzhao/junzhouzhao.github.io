## About


Junzhou Zhao received the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering
from [Xi’an Jiaotong University][xjtu], under the supervision of Prof.
[Xiaohong Guan][xhguan].
He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Computer
Science and Engineering][csecuhk] of [The Chinese University of Hong
Kong][cuhk], working with Prof. [John C.S. Lui][johnlui].
His research focuses on mining and measuring massive large-scale
networks/graphs with a particular interest in online social networks,
a.k.a. the [network science][networkscience].

![](/assets/img/news.gif) I am available on the job market, and interested
in becoming a research scientist, data scientist, or software engineer.
